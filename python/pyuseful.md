## print and return difference 
* print: gives the value to the user as an output string. print(3) would give a string '3' to the screen for the user to view. The program would lose the value.

* return: gives the value to the program. Callers of the function then have the actual data and data type (bool, int, etc...) return 3 would have the value 3 put in place of where the function was called.
